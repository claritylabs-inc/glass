/**
 * Shared operator MCP connection contract.
 *
 * The operator MCP server is the Convex site's `/mcp` endpoint. Operator
 * tokens are audience-bound to that exact URL and need both `read` and
 * `write` scope to reach the durable operator task tools, so the Codex
 * commands below pin the resource and the scopes explicitly.
 *
 * Used by the operator Channels UI, `scripts/setup-operator-mcp.mjs`, and
 * `docs/deployment/operator-mcp.md`.
